        <h2 class="nun6_50">Terms of sale</h2>
        <p>
            The following terms of sale apply to all purchases made in SAQ stores, on SAQ.COM and via the SAQ mobile application.
        </p>
        <p>
            All reference to “online” includes both SAQ.COM and the SAQ mobile application.
        </p>
        <h2 class="nun6_50">Price policy</h2>
        <p>
            The prices indicated on the SAQ.COM site are those established for consumer sales.<br><br>
            The applicable sales taxes are included in the prices displayed.<br><br>
            SAQ.COM reserves the right to modify the prices of products available on its site at any time, without prior notice.<br><br>
            All prices quoted on the SAQ.COM site are in Canadian dollars.<br><br>
            The prices of products available on SAQ.COM may differ from those posted in SAQ stores.<br><br>
            To make up for unpredictable fluctuations in the market, the SAQ reserves the right to modify the prices of products available on its site at any time, without prior notice.<br><br>
            SAQ.COM reduced prices do not apply at SAQ Dépôt stores, unless stated otherwise.
        </p>
        <h2 class="nun6_50">Vintage products</h2>
        <p>
            For vintage products, the vintage year in stock may differ from the one displayed on SAQ.COM.<br><br>
            Bottles may vary in appearance from the ones shown in product pages.
        </p>
        <p>    
            For any exchange or return regarding a vintage error, the customer must go to the store of his choice, regardless of if the product was purchased in store or online.
        </p>
        <h2 class="nun6_50">Law governing minors and inebriated people</h2>
        <p>
            Under section 103.9 of the Act regarding offences relating to alcoholic beverages, minors may not purchase alcohol for their own or someone else's consumption. Under section 117.1 of the
            same law, an adult may not purchase alcohol for a minor. Therefore, the SAQ is entitled to require an ID to ensure that the purchaser and the person who takes possession of the products
            are not minors.
        </p>
        <p>    
            Article 109 of the ARORAB prohibits the sale of alcoholic beverages to an inebriated person or to an adult when the seller or his representative knows that the alcoholic beverages are
            purchased by him for a person who is clearly under the influence of alcohol and that they are intended to be drunk by the latter.
        </p>
        <h2 class="nun6_50">Resale prohibited</h2>
        <p>
            The sale of alcoholic beverages is prohibited in Quebec unless it is carried out by a permit holder or if it is authorized by a legislative provision. It is therefore strictly forbidden for any person
            who does not hold a permit issued by the Régie des alcools des courses et des jeux to sell alcoholic beverages in Quebec, even if they have been acquired from the SAQ or any other person
            authorized to sell alcoholic beverages in Quebec.
        </p>
        <p>    
            According to the provisions of the ARORAB, when a person is found in possession of a considerable quantity of alcoholic beverages having regard to his condition and occupation, he is
            presumed to keep or possess it for the purpose of selling, which constitutes a prohibited sale within the meaning of the ARORAB.
        </p>
        <p>    
            The SAQ reserves the right to refuse to sell alcoholic beverages to any person who does not hold a permit when there is reason to believe that they are not intended for the personal
            consumption of the purchaser.
        </p>
        <h2 class="nun6_50">Limit of quantities purchased</h2>
        <p>
            The SAQ reserves the right to limit the number of alcoholic beverage containers purchased by the same person, whether due to the rarity of products purchased or due to the fact that the
            SAQ is of the opinion that the purchase is not for the personal consumption of the unlicensed purchaser.
        </p>
        <p>    
            The SAQ's right to limit the number of containers of alcoholic beverages purchased by a customer applies, whether the purchase is made in one or in several transactions.
        </p>
        <h2 class="nun6_50">Acceptance of the terms of sale</h2>
        <p>By purchasing a product in-store or online, the customer acknowledges being bound by the SAQ's terms of sale and accepting them.</p>
        <h2 class="nun6_50">Product availability</h2>
        <p>
            We keep your personal information only for the time required to fulfill the purpose for which it was gathered, the whole in accordance with our rules under our records retention schedule.
            The personal information will then be destroyed securely and confidentially.
        </p>
        <h2 class="nun6_50">In-store payment options</h2>
        <p>
            Purchases made at SAQ stores may be paid for with cash, certified cheque, postal money order, Interac debit card or credit card (MasterCard, Visa and American Express). The SAQ gift card
            and SAQ Inspire points are also accepted payment options.
        </p>
        <h2 class="nun6_50">In-store refund and exchange policy</h2>
        <p>
            Upon presentation of a sales receipt, the SAQ refunds any product purchased in an SAQ store in the last 90 days, under certain conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
            You must present the sales receipt when requesting a refund. For exchanges, the sales receipt is optional, provided that the following rules be complied with:
        </p>
        <p>    
            To be exchanged or reimbursed, the returned product must be sealed in order for the store to be able to sell the product again, or the product inside the container must be defective. In this
            case, the returned bottle must be at least three quarters full. Otherwise, the packaging, the bottle and the labels of a sealed product that be can be sold again must be in good condition. An
            open bottle that doesn't have any fabrication defect cannot be refunded or exchanged.
        </p>
        <p>    
            With or without a sales receipt, a product that can't be consumed due to a fabrication defect can be exchanged or reimbursed under certain conditions. The exchange or refund may take
            place in the store of your choice, even if the purchase was made in another point of sale in Quebec (store, SAQ agency or supermarket*). The bottle of a defective product must be at least
            three quarters full.
        </p>
        <p>    
            *The following policy applies to products purchased in a grocery or convenience store: if the product is defective, it may be exchanged or refunded at the SAQ store of your choosing. If the
            product hasn’t been opened, you must go to the grocery store or convenience store where you purchased it to obtain an exchange or a refund.
        </p>
        <h2 class="nun6_50">Product availability</h2>
        <p>
            The SAQ makes every effort to keep a sufficient inventory of the products offered on its website. However, the availability of these products is not guaranteed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The SAQ waives any liability in case of inventory shortages.
        </p>
        <p>    
            If the SAQ is unable to deliver a product ordered through its SAQ.COM site, the buyer will be notified accordingly by email or telephone. If such is the case, any amount charged to your
            credit card or any point deduction from the SAQ Inspire account for products, including delivery charges, will be credited as soon as possible, according to the same method used during the
            purchase.
        </p>
        <p>    
            The SAQ reserves the right to limit quantities ordered from its website.
        </p>
        <h2 class="nun6_50">In-store delivery</h2>
        <p>
            You can have your order delivered free of charge with the purchase of eligible products worth $75 or more (after all applicable rebates have been deducted).<br><br>
            If your online purchases are under $75, your order can be delivered for $6.<br><br>
            Orders are currently delivered in stores within an estimated delivery time of 3 to 5 business days.
        </p>
        <h2 class="nun6_50">Order pick up and age verification</h2>
        <p>
            When picking up your order in-store, please have the order number or the email notice confirming your order is ready with you. The identity and age of the person picking up the order and
            signing for it will be verified with one of the following identification cards: driver’s license, health insurance card, passport, citizenship card or any other valid form of photo ID issued by a
            government authority.
        </p>
        <p>    
            If you can not pick up the order yourself, you may send another person aged at least 18 years old in your stead. This person must have in their possession the order confirmation email or the
            in-store order pickup email notice, or the bill. This person will also have to provide a recognized form of ID.
        </p>
        <h2 class="nun6_50">Home delivery</h2>
        <p>Home delivery is available, for $12 per order. Deliveries are carried out by Purolator within an estimated delivery time of 3 to 5 business days.</p>
        <h2 class="nun6_50">Products delivered free of charge</h2>
        <p>All products shipped in envelopes, like gift cards, are delivered free of charge throughout Quebec. When a gift is offered online, it is shipped to the recipient of the order.</p>
        <h2 class="nun6_50">Proof of age required</h2>
        <p>Upon delivery of your order, the identity and age of the person receiving the parcel and signing the receipt are verified.</p>
        <h2 class="nun6_50">Legal age to purchase alcohol</h2>
        <p>
            Since alcohol is unlike any other product, the SAQ must comply with legislation governing the marketing of alcoholic beverages. This requires that every effort be made to ensure that SAQ
            products are sold and delivered only to individuals 18 years or older. To shop on SAQ.COM, you acknowledge that you are bound by and accept SAQ sales conditions. The buyer must be
            18 years old or over and must provide proof of this when the merchandise is delivered. To this effect, the buyer must show the SAQ one of the following documents: valid passport, valid
            driver's license, valid health insurance card. If the merchandise is received by a person other than the buyer, they must prove their majority. No delivery will be made to a person under 18,
            even if the alcoholic beverages were paid for beforehand.
