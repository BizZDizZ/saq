        <h2 class="nun6_50">Why do we gather your information?</h2>
        <p>We undertake to gather only the personal information required for the purpose for which it was gathered, including to successfully carry out our business activities. For example, by:</p>

            <li>studying, analyzing and preparing marketing activities;</li>
            <li>holding contests or surveys;</li>
            <li>recognizing you on our websites, mobile applications and digital terminals and knowing your preferences;</li>
            <li>improving the content of our websites, mobile applications and digital terminals;</li>

            <li>for any other reason required by law and to successfully conduct our business activities.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="nun6_50">Who has access to your personal information?</h2>
        <p>
            In addition to the situations provided for or required by law, access to personal information is limited to SAQ employees, mandataries, and approved providers specifically authorized by
            SAQ who need it to perform their work or mandate. They are required to comply not only with the law but also with SAQ's requirements regarding the protection of personal information.
            They must process this information only for the purposes mentioned above.
        </p>
        <h2 class="nun6_50">How do we use cookies?</h2>
        <p>
            Cookies are information saved by an HTTP server on the hard drives of your computers and other electronic devices to identify them (rather than the user). They facilitate navigation, in
            particular by memorizing your choice of navigation language and the products you have selected during your previous visits and allow us to process your orders. In addition, cookies allow
            us to adapt our websites, mobile applications and digital terminals so that they better suit your interests and preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most browsers automatically accept cookies. You may, however, deactivate them by modifying the confidentiality settings of your browser.
        </p>
        <p>     
            In addition, we use the services of Google Analytics to analyze our websites, our mobile applications and our digital terminals. The information collected through these services is
            anonymized so that it does not identify users. This information is used primarily to evaluate your use of our websites, mobile applications and digital terminals, including the number of
            visits, the pages viewed and the time spent on these pages, the source, and other statistics useful for continuous improvement of our websites, mobile applications and digital terminals.
        </p>
        <h2 class="nun6_50">How is your personal information protected?</h2>
        <p>
            We employ relevant security measures to protect your personal information from loss, theft, unauthorized access, disclosure, reproduction, use, unauthorized modification, and when
            transferring your information to a third party for processing or for any other purpose.
        </p>
        <p>    
            Moreover, when you make an online purchase from one of our websites or mobile applications, your credit card information is transmitted securely while transaction processing takes place
            with encryption mechanisms (Secure Sockets Layer protocol) used by your browser and our websites and mobile applications. No credit card information is kept or saved in any of our data
            bases.
        </p>
        <p>    
            Although we take steps to prevent any unauthorized access to your personal information, you will understand that we cannot guarantee the absolute protection and security of your
            information on the Internet. You therefore acknowledge and agree that we will not be held liable for any damages resulting from the transmission of confidential or personal information
            over the Internet and that such disclosure is at your own risk.
        </p>
        <h2 class="nun6_50">You are responsible for your accounts</h2>
        <p>Furthermore, you must do your part to ensure the security of your personal information. We invite you to act responsibly by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>creating a unique and complex password that includes letters (including upper case letters), numbers or symbols (e.g. ^, ¨,$,#, /), by inserting them in a simple password (in a way
                that makes sense) to make it complex;</li>
            <li>refraining from writing the password on a physical medium (e.g.: on your SAQ Inspire program membership card);</li>
            <li>frequently changing your password(s);</li>
            <li>refraining from disclosing your passwords, user or access codes to third parties;</li>
            <li>immediately informing us of any threat or loss of confidentiality regarding the passwords, user or access codes associated with your accounts.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="nun6_50">How long do we keep your personal information?</h2>
        <p>
            We keep your personal information only for the time required to fulfill the purpose for which it was gathered, the whole in accordance with our rules under our records retention schedule.
            The personal information will then be destroyed securely and confidentially.
        </p>
        <h2 class="nun6_50">Our undertaking on sending electronic mailings</h2>
        <p>We undertake to manage email addresses responsibly and use them in accordance with the law and your consent.</p>
        <p>
            When you enroll in our SAQ Inspire program or our websites and mobile applications, subject to your consent, we may, from time to time, send you promotional offers, rebates, or other
            advantages respecting products, services, contests and events by email, mail, text message or otherwise. These promotional offers may sometimes be personalized according to your
            interests, your purchases, the services you use, or any other information we have about you. This allows us to send you the promotional offers most likely to be of interest to you. In each
            mailing sent to you, you will have the possibility of removing your name and email address from our mailing list.
        </p>
        <p>    
            Furthermore, in certain circumstances and within the exceptions authorized by law, we remain authorized to send you emails and other electronic communications even if you have removed
            your name from our commercial mailings.
        </p>
        <h2 class="nun6_50">Northern villages</h2>
        <p>
            Some northern villages have enacted regulations providing that their residents must obtain the prior authorization of their local authorities to purchase alcoholic beverages.
        </p>
        <p>
            That is why any customer from these particular northern villages must authorize us, as the case may be, to send a copy of their order (which contains their personal information) to local
            authorities, thereby enabling us to receive confirmation that such local authority has authorized the order.
        </p>
        <h2 class="nun6_50">Official version</h2>
        <p>The French version of this Confidentiality Policy is the official version and it will take precedence over the translated English version.</p>
        <h2 class="nun6_50">Update of the Confidentiality Policy</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify this Confidentiality Policy at any time without prior notice. You may verify whether it has been updated by referring to the "Last updated" date indicated below.</p>
